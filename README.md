## Abstract
Neuroblastoma, the most common solid tumor causing cancer in infants, remains a leading cause of childhood cancer-related mortality. Despite advances in treatment, there is an ongoing need for more effective mathematical models and therapies to improve outcomes across neuroblastoma-specific patient populations. Immunotherapy and chemotherapy, particularly the use of Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and Cyclophosphamide, have shown promising therapeutic effects by enhancing immune responses and targeting cancer cells. Therefore, this study developed a coupled, nonlinear system of first-order differential equations to model the immune-cellular dynamics of neuroblastoma progression. The mathematical model captured the interactions between tumor cells, natural killer cells (NK), and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), while exploring how IL-2 and Cyclophosphamide influenced these cell populations. The model investigated tumor population dynamics across various patient profiles, assessing the therapeutic impact of IL-2 and Cyclophosphamide. This studies approach supports the optimization of immunotherapy and chemotherapy strategies, providing actionable insights on how to improve clinical outcomes in neuroblastoma treatment.

## Repository Overview
This repository contains scripts, data, and supplementary materials for an applied modeling study. The project focused on developing a system of coupled first-order ordinary differential equations to model tumor-immune dynamics and assess the effects of immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Specifically, the model captured interactions between tumor cells, natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and therapeutic agents.

## Study Objectives

This project explored the role of immunotherapy and chemotherapy in suppressing tumor growth, focusing on how immune responses and treatment strategies influence tumor dynamics. The primary objectives are:

- **Objective 1**: Develop a system of ordinary coupled differential equations to model interactions among natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and tumor cells.

- **Objective 2**: Evaluate the effects of immunotherapy and chemotherapy on distinct patient populations by simulating how therapeutic agents (IL-2 and Cyclophosphamide) modulate tumor growth and immune activation.

This study integrated immunological and pharmacokinetic components to simulate tumor progression under varying treatment scenarios. The model aimed to provide insights into how combination therapies can be optimized to improve clinical outcomes in neuroblastoma.
