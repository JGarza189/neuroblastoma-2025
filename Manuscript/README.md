### Abstract
Neuroblastoma, the most common solid tumor causing cancer in infants, remains a leading cause of childhood cancer-related mortality. Despite advances in treatment, there is an ongoing need for more effective mathematical models and therapies to improve outcomes across neuroblastoma-specific patient populations. Immunotherapy and chemotherapy, particularly the use of Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and Cyclophosphamide, have shown promising therapeutic effects by enhancing immune responses and targeting cancer cells. Therefore, this study developed a coupled, nonlinear system of first-order differential equations to model the immune-cellular dynamics of neuroblastoma progression. The mathematical model captured the interactions between tumor cells, natural killer cells (NK), and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), while exploring how IL-2 and Cyclophosphamide influenced these cell populations. The model investigated tumor population dynamics across various patient profiles, assessing the therapeutic impact of IL-2 and Cyclophosphamide. This studies approach supports the optimization of immunotherapy and chemotherapy strategies, providing actionable insights on how to improve clinical outcomes in neuroblastoma treatment.
