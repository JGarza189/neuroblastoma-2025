#### Abstract
Neuroblastoma, one of the most common solid cancerous tumors found in children is one of the leading causes of childhood cancer. Despite advancements in treatment, there is still an ongoing need for optimal therapy strategies and more accurate mathematical models to guide clinical decision-making for neuroblastoma patients. Among available treatments, immunotherapy and chemotherapy, particularly the use of Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and Cyclophosphamide, have shown encouraging results by enhancing the immune-response and targeting cancerous cells. Therefore, in this study we developed a nonlinear system of coupled first-order differential equations to simulate the interactions between tumor cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The model accounted for the effects of IL-2 and Cyclophosphamide on these immune cell populations, by examining tumor dynamics across different patient risk groups. The resulting framework provides a theoretical approach to optimizing therapeutic strategies and improving clinical outcomes in neuroblastoma treatment.
