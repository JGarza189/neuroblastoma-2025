## Scripts

### model.toml

Generates a FastQC report, a quality control tool for high-throughput sequence data on one or more FASTQ files. This script simplifies the process of running FastQC, producing detailed HTML reports and raw data summaries to assess the quality of sequencing reads.

#### Usage:

To run `model.toml`,

Something here about running it in Jupyter Notebook:

### model.txt

Reads a csv file containing BLAST output (description table), extracts and analyzes the top 10 most frequent genera, and generates dot and bar plots saved in a new plot directory. 

#### Usage:

To utilize `model.txt`,

Something here about running it in Jupyter Notebook:

### modeling_utils.py

Reads a csv file containing BLAST output (description table), extracts and analyzes the top 10 most frequent genera, and generates dot and bar plots saved in a new plot directory. 

#### Usage:
