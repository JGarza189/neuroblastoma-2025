## Scripts

This directory contains the core scripts used to define, execute, and analyze the tumor-immune simulation models described in the study. Each file contributes to model construction, parameter configuration, simulation logic, or result visualization.

All scripts are intended to be used within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

### model.toml  
Configuration file for model setup.

### model.txt  
Alternate model configuration file.

### modeling_utils.py  
Utility functions supporting model execution and analysis.

### run_model.py  
Main script to initialize and run the tumor-immune model.

### parameters-mk04.txt  
Parameter set for the original model formulation.

### parameters-mk04-nondimensional.txt  
Parameter set for the nondimensionalized version of the model.

### stability_analysis.ipynb  
Notebook for performing equilibrium and stability analysis.
