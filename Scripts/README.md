## Scripts

### model.toml

Generates a FastQC report, a quality control tool for high-throughput sequence data on one or more FASTQ files. This script simplifies the process of running FastQC, producing detailed HTML reports and raw data summaries to assess the quality of sequencing reads.

#### Usage:

To run the script, 

`./script-1.py <fasta_file1> <fasta_file2> ... <fasta_fileN>`
