## Computer Set-up

To run simulations and reproduce the results presented in this study, you can use the **Jupyter Notebook interface**, a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows for interactive control of simulation parameters and real-time visualization of outputs. Alternatively, simulations may be executed through the **command line interface (CLI)** for a more automated, script-based workflow.

Before getting started, ensure the following tools and libraries are installed on your system:

#### Software

- **Python 3.9 or higher**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Git** – for cloning the repository and using the command line

#### Python Libraries

This project relies on the following Python libraries:

- `numpy` – numerical operations and arrays  
- `scipy` – solving ordinary differential equations  
- `pandas` – data manipulation and organization  

## Directory & Dependency Set-up

### 1. Clone the Repository

Either clone the repository directly from GitHub using the web interface, or use the following BASH command to clone it into your desired local directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JGarza189/neuroblastoma-25.git
```

## Running Simulations
To run simulations and reproduce the results presented in this study:

### 1. Navigate to the Cloned GitHub Repository in Jupyter Notebook

Using Jupyter Notebook, load the scripts into your environment in the following order:

```
1. Script 1

2. Script 2

3. Script 3

4. Script 4
```

Once loaded, run the python script in order. If desired, export the outputs manually to a `Desired/` directory.

Simulations generated include graphical outputs representing tumor and immune cell population dynamics over time under various treatment conditions.
